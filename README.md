# totality-checker

This repository is a work-in-progress Haskell implementation of a type checker with
dependent types and totality checks. The totality checks include 

- strict positivity checks,
- pattern matching coverage checks, and 
- termination checks. 

I follow some of the works of 
- 'Termination
checking for a dependently typed
language'
by Karl Mehltretter (2007) and 
- 'Towards a practical programming
language based on dependent type theory' by Ulf Norell (2007).
